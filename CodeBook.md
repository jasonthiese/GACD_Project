## OUTPUT

The output of run_analyses.R consists of two datasets, tidy.data.1.csv and tidy.data.2.csv.

 * ### tidy.data.1.csv

#### description

This dataset consists of all features having to do with the mean or standard deviation of a measurement.  In addition, the activity labels, subject IDs, and data usage ("train" or "test") have been added on the left.  Activity IDs were transformed to an activity factor for clarity of presentation.

 * ### tidy.data.2.csv

This data consists of the the mean measurements for each subject for each activity.  The means were calculated for all measurements, not just the ones involving a mean or standard deviation.

## NOTE

Only one dataset could be uploaded with the project, so I decided to upload the first tidy dataset.  The second can be found in this repository.
